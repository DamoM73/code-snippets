    "# Debugging with Thonny\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone makes mistakes—even seasoned professional developers!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is pretty good at catching mistakes like syntax errors and run-time errors, but there’s a third type of error that you may have already experienced. **Logic errors** occur when an otherwise valid program doesn’t do what was intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic errors cause unexpected behaviors called **bugs**. Removing bugs is called **debugging**, and a **debugger** is a tool that helps you hunt down bugs and understand why they’re happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how to find and fix bugs in your code is a skill that you will use for your entire coding career!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Thonny's Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "Thonny has a debugger built-in. Before we explore it, we need to ensure you have the correct setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the *View* menu and ensure both *Stack* and *Variables* are ticked.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Thonny view menu](./assets/debugging_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To enter into Thonny's Debugger click on the **Debug** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Thonny bug button](./assets/debugging_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contolling the debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how the debugger works, let’s start by writing a simple program without any bugs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type the following into Thonny and save it as `debug_a.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "names = [\"michelle\", \"nicole\", \"simone\", \"emma\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for name in names:\n",
    "    name = name.capitalize()\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello {name} how are you this morning\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now start Thonny's dubugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Thonny should now look like the image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging started](./assets/debugging_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Panel:** The execution of code is paused and the next block of code to be executed is highlighted yellow\n",
    "- **Variables Panel:** Nothing is displayed as no values have been assigned to any variables yet.\n",
    "- **Shell Panel:** `%Debug` launches the program (`debug_a.py`) in debugging mode.\n",
    "- **Stack Panel:** Shows the current function and module that is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something else has happened, other debugging buttons are now available.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dubugging control buttons](./assets/debugging_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets see how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step into button\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the **Step into** button. Thonny will now execute the previous highlighted code block. The new highlighted code indicated the next part of the code to be excuted. In this case it is the list `[\"michelle\", \"nicole\", \"simone\", \"emma\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 1](./assets/debugging_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking **Step into** again highlights the `\"michelle\"` showing that Python will now evaluated this item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing and the `\"michelle\"` turns into a blue `'michelle'` indicating that it is has been read byt he interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 2](./assets/debugging_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Four more **Step into** clicks (or pressing F7 on your keyboard), and all the strings have been read by the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 3](./assets/debugging_7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next **Step into** shows that Python is now ready to write the list into the vairable `names`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 4](./assets/debugging_8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next **Step into** moves to the next block of code to be processed, and we can see in the **Variables panel** that `[\"michelle\", \"nicole\", \"simone\", \"emma\"]` has been stored in `names`. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 5](./assets/debugging_9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that more than one line is highlighted. Thonny is highlighting all the code that is part of the `for` loop. We'll now step through this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step into** highlights `names` as the first element of the `for` statement that needs to be processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 6](./assets/debugging_10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A futher **Step into** replaces `names` with the list that is stored in `names`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 7](./assets/debugging_11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a `for` loop, the next **Step into** takes the first element of the list (`'michelle'`) and prepares to store it in the variable `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: do not confuse `name` with `names`. They're very close, but Python is very precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 7](./assets/debugging_12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking **Step into** moves the highlight onto line 4, and the `name` variable is now also displayed in the **Variables panel**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 8](./assets/debugging_13.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next three **Step into** clicks highlights the `name.capitalize()` , then `name` and finally replaces `name` with `'michelle'`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 9](./assets/debugging_14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next three **Step into** clicks then apply the `capitalize()` method to `'michelle'` changing it to `'Michelle'` and then overwrites the value in `name` with `'Michelle'`. Line 4 is now comlpete, so line 5 is now highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 10](./assets/debugging_15.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next five **Step into** clicks show how an f-string is processed and then printed to the terminal. It also show that a call to the `print()` function returns a `None` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 10](./assets/debugging_16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click **Step into** one more time and you return to line 3 and the `for` statement, with the next element from the `names` list (`'nicole'`) ready to be writen to the `name` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 11](./assets/debugging_17.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click **Step into** one more time, and then we'll use this next iteration of the `for` loop to look at how **Step over** works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step over button\n",
    "The **Step over** function will process all the highlighted code without going into the detailed steps. In the situation below **Step over** will take the value stored in `name` (`'nicole'`), capitalize it to `'Nicole'` and then write it back to `name`. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 12](./assets/debugging_18.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the **Step over** button and you will see the results below. Notice the value stored in `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 13](./assets/debugging_19.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click **Step over** again and line 5 is executed and the highlight returns to the line 3 `for` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **Step over** when we know that the highlighted code doesn't contain the bug we are looking for, so we want to simply execute it and move onto the next block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click **Step over** and then **Step into** to move your code to the position below, so we can now look out **Step out**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 14](./assets/debugging_20.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step out button\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Step out** is used to complete the remainder of the block of code currently being processed. Look back at the last example, and notice the grey box around line 4? This box indicates that we have stepped into line 4 and are processing it. Click **Step out** and Thonny will move back up a level to highlight all of line 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 15](./assets/debugging_21.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click **Step out** again will move back up to outside the `for` loop and, therefore, finish the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resume button and breakpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "The last button we need to look at is the **Resume** button. This work in conjunction with **breakpoints**. Basically the **Resume** button will execute the code until it finds a **breakpoint**. To add a **breakpoint** to your code click on the line nubmer that you wish to pause the program on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it out. Click on the line number 4. A red dot should appear between the number and the code panel (as below):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 16](./assets/debugging_22.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now click **Debug**. Notice that the program runs and then pauses at **breakpoint** where you can the values of all the variables at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 17](./assets/debugging_23.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you now click **Resume** the program will keep running until the next **breakpoint**, which is also line 4 on the second iteration of the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debugging step 18](./assets/debugging_24.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Notice the changed values in the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to control Thonny's debugger, lets look at how to use it to debug a logic error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging a Logic Error\n",
    "\n",
    "To debug a program, we are going to need a buggy program. Create a new Python file, type the follwing code in and save it as `debug_b.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def add_underscores(word):\n",
    "    new_word = \"_\"\n",
    "    for index in range(len(word)):\n",
    "        new_word = word[index] + \"_\"\n",
    "    return new_word\n",
    "\n",
    "phrase = \"hello\"\n",
    "print(add_underscores(phrase))\n",
